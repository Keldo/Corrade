# Corrade

Corrade is an Open Source Metaverse Client

When the original developers were ask why this project was not on Github, I was told "What the Fuck do you care?"
and then a few other choice anti american terms.

My response, with a smile, its on Github now and it will contnue to be so.

#From its parent domain
Corrade is a multi-purpose scripted agent (bot) written in C# that runs as a system daemon, without any graphical interface and stays connected to a Linden-based grid (either Second Life or OpenSim) while being controlled entirely from in-world LSL scripts or external scripts (such as PHP, Perl, etc...). We like to think of Corrade as a bridge, that gives access to viewer-commands to LSL scripts that would not normally be able to perform certain actions.
