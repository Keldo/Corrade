Turing described his original "Game" in "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," Mind, Vol. Lix, No. 236 (1950). Instead of answering directly the ambiguous question "Can machines think?" Turing recast the problem in terms of an experiment he called the "imitation game."

The "Turing Test" is the name given to a variety of experiments designed to test computer thinking.  Whole conferences are dedicated to the question of what Turing meant in his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," where he proposed the idea of an "imitation game" to decide the question, "Can machines think?"

My current favorite historical computer scientist is Konrad Zuse,  who built a series of electromechanical computers in the 1930's  and 1940's in Germany.  Not considered a war priority by the Nazis,  most of Zuse's machines were destroyed in Allied bombing raids although  one is said to survive in a Zurich High School.  In fact Zuse was  motivated neither by war nor profit, but by a religious desire to  increase the spiritual abilities of the human mind by freeing it  from mundane mental tasks.
