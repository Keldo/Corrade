  No. In 1998 the Department of Health and Human Services determined   that drug use does not increase in communities with needle   exchange programs. Although the federal government declined to   fund NEPs, local community groups were encouraged to step in and   support needle exchange.

      <Pattern>HOW LARGE IS THE HEPATITIS C PROBLEM</Pattern>
      <Response>
  A large number of Americans were infected with Hepatitis C through the blood supply, which was not systematically screened for the virus until 1992. 720 Georgians have been diagnosed with Hepatitis C disease since 1993; many more are infected but not ill. Since the blood supply is now safe and the virus is not easily transmitted sexually, most new cases of Hepatitus C are attributable to injection drug use.

      <Response>
      Nationally there have been over 600,000 people diagnosed with AIDS        since 1981. 25% if AIDS cases were linked to injection drug use.        An unknown number of Americans are infected with HIV. Georgia,        with approximately 18,700 cases reported since 1981, ranks among        the top ten states with the most AIDS cases. As many as 30,000        Georgians are estimated to be infected with HIV; 20% of 1998 AIDS        diagnoses were linked to injection drug use. In Atlanta, there is        an estimated 20,000 injection drug users. It is not known how many        are infected with HIV.

      <Response>
  Yes. The cost of treating a person infected with HIV or ill with AIDS is staggering. Teatment for HEP C is also expensive. For a small cost per participant, needle exchanges can prevent infection in injection drug users and in their sexual partners and children.

      <Response>
      People infected with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), Hepatitis        C, and other diseases when they share needles. Both HIV and        Hepatitis C can be fatal. Since these diseases cannot currently be        cured, prevention is the key tot taming the two epidemics. Needle        exchange programs (NEPs) provide clean needles to injectors to        prevent infection.
